            &emsp;I originally started my journey into the programming world when I started to <br>
            go to collage for front end web development. However in the later half or the<br>
            semester as I was taking a introduction to programming class, I discovered that<br>
            I really enjoyed programming, and so, over the course of the summer break, I spent <br>
            a lot of my time learning and using JavaScript and decided to become a full stack<br>
             developer.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; As I was getting the credits needed for my Certificate in Web Application <br>
            Development I discovered with only a couple of extra classes I could also get a   <br>
            Certificate in Software Development. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; After getting the credits needed for both of Certificates complete I figured <br>
            that I would need some sort of experience to be able to get hired as a developer. I <br>
            had heard at this point how hard it was to get a entry level job, so instead of doing <br>
            what everybody else was doing, I decided the best way for me to get experience was  <br>
            for me to build my own project.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Knowing how big of a undertaking that this would end up being, I committed <br>
            myself to writing at least one line of code a day, so that I wouldn't just give up  <br>
            and stop on the project half way through. Fortunately my plan worked and I was able <br>
            to complete my Dungeons and Dragons AI Game Master, which you can find at <br>
            <a href="https://home.wizardchat.xyz/">home.wizardchat.xyz</a>. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Now I am working on a DC20 (DC20 is a table top role playing game similar to <br>
            Dungeons and Dragons) character creator while looking for a job.
