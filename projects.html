            This project was made as a way to play Dungeons and Dragons. While I was making it I:
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built my own account creation/login system. 
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a UI to display the following:
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - Options for speech to text.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - Ability to select different LLM's.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - A taggable advance setting section that give access to the AI's <br>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; memory and system prompt.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - A chat history list with options to delete the past chats you don't want.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - A chat display that shows options to resend last sent chat and delete <br> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; past messages sent.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - A chat input area that grows as the message that is being typed out grows.
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; - A toggle mic button.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Worked with third party API's that were hosting the LLM's
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a system to store, retrieve, and update all the chats for each user.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a custom long term memory system.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a credit system to keep users from spamming messages and draining my bank account.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Integrated a paypal so people could buy more credits.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a home page that displays different D&D games you can play through.
            <br>
            &emsp; - Built a system so you can make your own games.

        <p id="aboutBox">
            I made this project as a quick and easy way to procedurally generate creatures for Dungeons and Dragons.<br>  
            I never finished adding all of the different monster types, as I instead started to work on my AI system.
            The<br>  entirety of this software was made using just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

        <p id="aboutBox">
            This was a small project that I made to help me learn php. The user inputs the number of dice (x) that<br>
            they want to roll, then "d" for die, then the size of the dice (y), is "xdy" format. Example 1d20. If<br>
            the user wants to add a modifier at the end of the roll, they can just add it on, example: 2d6+5. The <br>
            string with all of the information is then sent to the server where php code parses the string for the  <br>
            information and then returns the dice roll to the user.
